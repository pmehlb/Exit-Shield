# Exit-Shield

### pleaseeeeee stop exiting out of Ghost Suite Solution :/

---

A VB.NET application written to select a process and temporarily disable its "X" button in the top right to prevent people from accidentally closing it.

Mainly written because when you RDP, people mix up the exit of an app many of the lab workers have to use with the exit button for the RDP session...
